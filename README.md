# Unexpected Empty Array Return in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB where a function may return an empty array (`[]`) instead of a numerical value when an unexpected condition occurs. This can lead to unexpected behavior in functions or scripts that call the problematic function.

## Bug Description

The provided code shows a MATLAB function (`myFunction.m`) that, under certain conditions, returns an empty array instead of a numerical result.  This may cause issues in calling functions that expect a numerical value as the output.

## Bug Solution

The fix is shown in `myFunction_fixed.m`. The function is modified to handle cases where it might not be able to compute a numerical result and returns a default value or an error message accordingly. This makes it more robust and prevents unexpected behaviors.
